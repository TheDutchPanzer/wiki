[Sulack](sulack) is the server owner and lead developer of the [ScrubCraft](scrubcraft) Minecraft server. Sulack was probably one of the first players on the Scrubcraft server. However this is his moderator account and he does not play survival on it. When he actualy does play survival he will be playing from his alt [Kcalus](kcalus).

## History

Not much is known about the history of his moderator account since he mostly was busy with the server. Though a lot of footage of his work on the server is available on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYO5axZoTcEEX_FQKsDFrQ). The most viewed video on his YouTube channel is a [introduction video](https://youtu.be/T9J56Wdcx98) for the Scrubcraft Minecraft server.

One of the most notable events in the history of Sulack was when announced that "The age of Market-Driven freedom" is over and that the "perfect, never flawed Dictatorsh....Peoples Democratic Republic has been formed". After this announcement he also changed his skin to a Kim Jong-un like version of his skin.

One of his most impactful additions to the server may be the [10K](10k) and the [Outlaw](outlaw) system.

## Activities

Unlike what many players believe Sulack can see and do a lot more things than they realize. Sulack can and will for example see what you are saying with the /msg command. Sometimes Sulack will fly arround in vanish and see what you are up too. Some players might say that this is unfair, however this is a pretty standard practice for a server owner and almost every owner of a server has this ability.

Sulack also tends to AFK a lot, but do not let this deceive you since he just might be not responding to your messages.

Over the course of the server Sulack has added/removed a lot of things to the Minecraft server. Some notable things sulack has added to Minecraft server are:

- [Spawn](spawn) (Over the course of the server the spawn has changed a lot.)
- [Cosmetics](cosmetics)
- [Headhunter](headhunter) (A sword which drops a players head when they are killed with this sword.)
- [EdgeStone](edgestone)
- [Modtown](modtown) (A town created by the original players of ScrubCraft where some player owned shops.)
- [Server Hearts](server_hearts)
